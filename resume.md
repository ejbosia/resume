## Experience

### Software Engineer IV | Kasalis
**February 2025 – Present**

* Led software development on a cross-functional team to develop an dual-purpose LCOS and LED alignment machine, resulting in the product's on-schedule launch.
* Collaborated closely with Process Engineers to define requirements for future machine configuration; restructured configuration file architecture to support multi-machine deployment, and created a Python module to validate TOML file contents.
* Defined technical requirements and authored high-level design specifications used by the broader team, mentoring junior engineers on best practices and code review standards.
* Refactored the hardware control node and TwinCAT function blocks to use message sequencing mechanism (logical clocks), eliminating 99% of race conditions in hardware control messaging.

### Software Engineer III | Kasalis
**November 2022 – February 2025**

* Led software development of a hybrid alignment and test machine achieving a 50% cycle time reduction and successfully passing the site acceptance test.
* Refactored the legacy code base for multi-station functionality and future extensibility; standardized the codebase by implementing pytest unit testing, docstrings, and automated documentation using Sphinx.
* Engineered C++ DLLs, Python modules, and cffi wrappers to interface hardware; implemented standardized drivers for IDS Peak cameras, a Vötsch temperature chamber, and a programmable power supply using the NI-VISA protocol.
* Developed a predictive screening algorithm by refactoring the alignment process to estimate lens convergence from a single scan; implemented across seven production machines deployed globally.

### Software Engineer | RightHand Robotics
**October 2021 – October 2022**

* Optimized robot pathing behavior to eliminate 90% of post-pick gripper-workspace collisions,  increasing pick reliability.
* Created custom Python and Bash tooling for robot performance analysis and debugging.
* Solved difficult bugs involving arm-trajectory smoothing, collisions, and race conditions by performing hands-on diagnostics directly on the robots.

### R&D Engineer | Formultrix
**August 2017 – August 2020**

* Engineered a robotic "poking" tool to automate a manual production step that acted as a throughput bottleneck, increasing the rate of the critical step by 500%; this solution was controlled via a C# Windows Form application leveraging OpenCV for required vision tasks.
* Developed a Python script utilizing OpenCV to analyze fluorescent sample grids and calculate PCR concentration results; this was engineered for deployment on a Raspberry Pi. 
* Prototyped a QC scoring tool combining OpenCV for feature extraction and Scikit-learn; built an image labeling program using C# with Windows Forms to generate training data.
* Provided Tier-2 onsite engineering support for the Constellation dPCR system, resolving complex hardware/software issues via deep debugging, soldering, and software support ticketing to maintain high customer satisfaction.
* Prototyped a high-speed plate transfer tool to resolve a process bottleneck; designed components using SolidWorks, fabricated parts via CNC milling, and controlled motion with pneumatics and an Arduino, achieving a rapid 10-minute amplification time. 
* Designed and manufactured mechanical components for the Constellation dPCR system, utilizing SolidWorks for modeling and CNC Lathe/Mill processes for fabrication.
