## Experience

### Software Engineer IV | Kasalis
**February 2025 – January 2026**

* Led software development on a cross-functional team to deliver a dual-purpose LCoS and LED alignment machine on schedule.
* Collaborated with process engineers to define requirements for future machine configuration. Restructured config file architecture to support multi-machine deployment and created a Python module to validate the config file contents.
* Defined design specifications and reviewed code for junior engineers, emphasizing readability and maintainability.
* Refactored the hardware control node and TwinCAT function blocks to use logical clocks, eliminating race conditions in hardware control messaging.

### Software Engineer III | Kasalis
**November 2022 – February 2025**

* Led software development of an LCoS alignment machine achieving a 50% cycle time reduction and successfully passing the site acceptance test.
* Refactored the legacy codebase for multi-station functionality and future extensibility. Standardized the codebase by implementing pytest unit tests, docstrings, and automated Sphinx documentation.
* Engineered C++ DLLs, Python modules, and cffi wrappers to interface with hardware. Implemented drivers for IDS Peak cameras, a Vötsch temperature chamber, and a programmable power supply using the NI-VISA protocol.
* Developed a predictive screening algorithm to estimate lens convergence from a single scan. Deployed this algorithm across seven new machines in production.
* Supported legacy production machines by collaborating remotely with factory technicians to debug issues and deploy updates.

### Software Engineer | RightHand Robotics
**October 2021 – October 2022**

* Optimized robot pathing behavior to eliminate 90% of post-pick gripper-workspace collisions, increasing pick reliability.
* Created custom Python and Bash tooling for robot performance analysis and debugging.
* Solved difficult bugs involving arm-trajectory smoothing, collisions, and race conditions by performing hands-on diagnostics on the robots.

### R&D Engineer | Formulatrix
**August 2017 – August 2020**

* Engineered a robotic "poking" tool to automate a manual production step, increasing the rate by 500%. Controlled the system via a C# Windows Forms application and used OpenCV for target detection.
* Developed a Python script utilizing OpenCV to calculate PCR concentration results by analyzing fluorescent sample grids, deployed on a Raspberry Pi.
* Implemented a QC scoring tool combining OpenCV for feature extraction and Scikit-learn. Built an image labeling program using C# with Windows Forms to generate training data.
* Provided Tier-2 onsite engineering support for the Constellation dPCR system, resolving complex hardware/software issues through debugging, soldering, and software support ticketing to maintain high customer satisfaction.
* Prototyped a high-speed plate transfer tool to resolve a process bottleneck. Designed components using SolidWorks, fabricated parts via CNC milling, and controlled motion with pneumatics and an Arduino, achieving a rapid 10-minute amplification time.
