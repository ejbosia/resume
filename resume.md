## Experience

### Software Engineer IV | Kasalis
**February 2025 – Present**

* Led software development on a cross-functional team to develop an LCOS and LED alignment machine, resulting in the product's on-schedule launch.
* Collaborated closely with Process Engineers to define requirements for future machine configuration; restructured configuration file architecture to support multi-machine deployment, and created a Python module to validate TOML file contents.
* Defined technical requirements and authored high-level design specifications used by the broader team, mentoring junior engineers on best practices and code review standards.
* Refactored the hardware control node and TwinCAT function blocks to use message sequencing mechanism (logical clocks), eliminating 100% of race conditions in hardware control messaging.

### Software Engineer III | Kasalis
**November 2022 – February 2025**

* Led software development of a hybrid alignment and test machine achieving a 50% cycle time reduction and successfully passing the site acceptance test.
* Refactored the legacy code base for multi-station functionality and future extensibility; standardized the codebase by implementing pytest unit testing, docstrings, and automated documentation using Sphinx.
* Engineered C++ DLLs, Python modules, and cffi wrappers to interface hardware; implemented standardized drivers for IDS Peak cameras, a Vötsch temperature chamber, and a programmable power supply using the NI-VISA protocol.
* Developed a predictive screening algorithm by refactoring the alignment process to estimate lens convergence from a single scan; implemented across seven production machines deployed globally.

### Software Engineer | RightHand Robotics
**October 2021 – October 2022**
* Eliminated 90% of post-pick gripper-workspace collisions by adjusting robot pathing behavior.
* Created custom Python and Bash tooling for robot performance analysis and debugging.
* Solved difficult bugs involving arm-trajectory smoothing, collisions, and race conditions.

### R&D Engineer | Formultrix
**August 2017 – August 2020**
* Increased the rate of a critical step in plate production by 500% by developing a robotic "poking" tool.
* Developed a production-facing Windows Form app using C# and OpenCV to provide an intuitive interface for the robotic tool.
* Developed a script utilizing Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and Pandas to process fluorescent sample grids and calculate PCR concentration results.
* Prototyped a QC scoring tool combining OpenCV for feature extraction and Scikit-learn; built an image labeling program using C# with Windows Forms to generate training data.
* Handled onsite engineering support requests for the Constellation dPCR system.
