## Experience

### Software Engineer IV - Kasalis

2025 - present

 - Led software development for an LCOS and LED alignment machine that shipped on schedule.
 - Defined requirements, created specs, and reviewed code with junior engineers.
 - Designed scalable configuration and calibration systems to support multiple machines.
 - Improved the performance and stability of the node-based architecture by migrating components to use  logical clocks to determine status message validity.
 - Developed custom G-code generation tools to allow technicians to generate paths easily from TOML.

### Software Engineer III - Kasalis

2022 - 2025

 - Led software development for an alignment machine that achieved 50% cycle time improvement and passed the site acceptance test. Worked with the customer to define machine requirements and features.
 - Created C++ DLLs and Python modules to Interface with cameras and other hardware.
 - Converted an existing alignment machine into a screening tool by predicting the convergence of a lens with a single scan. Seven of these machines were shipped and used in production.
 - Integrated customer feature requests into existing, mature code.

### Software Engineer - RightHand Robotics

2021 - 2022

 - Eliminated 90% of post-pick gripper-workspace collisions by adjusting robot pathing behavior.
 - Created custom Python and Bash tooling for robot performance analysis and debugging.
 - Solved difficult bugs involving arm-trajectory smoothing, collisions, and race conditions.

### R&D Engineer - Formultrix 

2017 - 2020

 - Increased the rate of a critical step in plate production by 500% by developing a robotic “poking” tool.  - Developed a Windows Form app with C# and OpenCV for ease of use by production.
 - Created a script to process images of fluorescent sample grids into PCR concentration results. This was run on a Raspberry Pi with OpenCV for image processing and Pandas for data analysis.
 - Prototyped QC tool combining OpenCV for feature extraction and Scikit-learn for scoring. Built an image labeling program using C# with Windows Forms to generate training data.
 - Handled onsite engineering support requests for the Constellation dPCR system.
